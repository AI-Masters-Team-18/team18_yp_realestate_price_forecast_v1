This is the *new* SSL certificate, effective from September 2024. Please use this certificate for all new projects and avoid using the previous certificate.

IMPORTANT: to use this certificate, you must use port 33335 when connecting to Bright Data's proxy network, even if documentation and sample codes provided mention port 22225. Documentation will gradually be updated to port 33335 as the old certificate is being phased out.

You have a few options to use this certificate:

- If you write code, you can simply load it into your existing code.
- If you are using Windows and third-party tools that allow you to configure proxy settings (like AdsPower, Proxifier, Multilogin, Undetectable etc.) you can install the certificate on your computer using the installer.

Again, remember: you MUST use port 33335 when connecting to Bright Data's proxy network, even if documentation and sample codes provided mention port 22225.
